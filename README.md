# IKONt ski without a reservation


Ski resorts now require reservations to be made in advance of skiing to prevent the spread of Covid. Making these reservations often gets competitive as everyone tries to go all on the same day. People are always cancelling and re-booking to get their spot. Time for a selenium script!

Note: This script only works with resorts that allow reservations to be made directly on the Ikon site.
